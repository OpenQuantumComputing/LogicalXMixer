# LogicalXMixer
Proof of concept implementation to find optimal mixers. The code is far from an optimal implementation, so do not expect good run times.

Run [sample](deprecated/sample.sh) to get the average cost for randomly chosen B, or open the notebook [Example Usage][examples/example_usage.ipynb] to see how the optimization algroithm is run and a few examples.

If you use the code, citing our paper is highly appreciated [https://doi.org/10.22331/q-2024-11-25-1535](https://doi.org/10.22331/q-2024-11-25-1535).
