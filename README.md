# LogicalXMixer
Proof of concept implementation to find optimal mixers. The code is far from an optimal implementation, so do not expect good run times.

Run [sample](sample.sh) to get the average cost for randomly chosen B, or open the notebook [LogicalXMixer](LogicalXMixer.ipynb) to see a few examples.

If you use the code, citing our paper is highly appreciated. [https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17083](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17083).
